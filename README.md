# Hi

Hello,
  I have been slowly gaining knowledge over several years on how to code. However, soon I will be attending university for computer science. I currently have only written very basic scripts in python and I'm learning how to config programs using lua. I'm learning how to use GitHub and Git in general, as I used it for a day or two years ago, but nowadays I have been only using it for searching and downloading programs for my machine. About a year ago I completely switched to Linux, and I have only used Debian based distros so far. One day I'll install Arch (just for the meme, btw,) but I don't think I'll use it because I don't like the idea of a bleeding edge system (yet.) Currently, I use Linux Mint on my desktop.
